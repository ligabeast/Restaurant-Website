## 1.Description

I created this project to improve my Laravel/PHP knowledge. At the time when i developed this Project, i wasn't familiar with javascript, so i would do most of it differently today.

Mainsite:

A non authenticated user would only see "sign-in" and "register".



On the Mainsite users are able to send Tickets
